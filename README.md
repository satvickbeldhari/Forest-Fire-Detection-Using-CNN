# Forest Fire Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the presence of fire in images. The system processes visual data to classify inputs into two categories: "Fire" and "No Fire." Its real-time application can assist in early forest fire detection and response, helping mitigate environmental and economic losses.

---

## Features
- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishes between "Fire" and "No Fire."
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Processes live video feeds or image datasets for fire detection.
- **Scalable Solution**: Easily adaptable to different environments and datasets.
- **User-Friendly**: Can be integrated into web or mobile platforms.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Dataset**: Images labeled as "Fire" and "No Fire"

---

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Collect and preprocess images into "Fire" and "No Fire" categories.
   - Resize and normalize image data for consistency.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Employ a CNN with layers like convolutional, pooling, and fully connected.
   - Optimize the model for high classification accuracy.

3. **Training and Testing**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - Train the CNN on labeled data and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Use the trained model to process live feeds or static images.
   - Generate alerts when fire is detected.
